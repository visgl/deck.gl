Starting with v8.1, deck.gl has support for ArcGIS with the [@deck.gl/arcgis](../../api-reference/arcgis/overview.md) module.

2D integration with `MapView` is supported by the [DeckLayer](../../api-reference/arcgis/deck-layer.md) class, see [pure JS example](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/tree/9.0-release/examples/get-started/pure-js/arcgis).

3D integration with `SceneView` is experimental: see the [DeckRenderer](../../api-reference/arcgis/deck-renderer.md) class.
