# Using deck.gl with other basemap services

It is possible to use the map component without the Mapbox service, you need a URL that conforms to the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec) and pass it to `ReactMapGL` using the `mapStyle` prop.

You can use existing free vector tile services:

- [CARTO free basemaps](https://carto.com/basemaps) for non commercial applications. Checkout [this guide](/docs/api-reference/carto/basemap.md) to start using it.

## Hosting your own basemap service

If you host your own map tiles, you will need a custom Mapbox GL style that points to your own [vector tile source](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/), this custom style must match the schema of your tile source.

Open source tile schemas include:

- [TileZen schema](https://tilezen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layers/)
- [OpenMapTiles schema ](https://openmaptiles.org/schema/)

Some useful resources for creating your own map service:

- [Open source tools](https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles)
- [Maputnik Style editor](https://maputnik.github.io)
