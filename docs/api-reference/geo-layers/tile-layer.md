# TileLayer

The `TileLayer` is a composite layer that makes it possible to visualize very large datasets. Instead of fetching the entire dataset, it only loads and renders what's visible in the current viewport.

To use this layer, the data must be sliced into "tiles". Each tile has a pre-defined bounding box and level of detail.
Users have the option to load each tile from a unique URL, defined by a template in the `data` property.
The layer can also supply a callback `getTileData` that does custom fetching when a tile is requested.
The loaded tile data is then rendered with the layer(s) returned by `renderSubLayers`.

```js
import DeckGL from '@deck.gl/react';
import {BitmapLayer} from '@deck.gl/layers';
import {TileLayer} from '@deck.gl/geo-layers';

function App({viewState}) {
  const layer = new TileLayer({
    // https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames#Tile_servers
    data: 'https://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',

    minZoom: 0,
    maxZoom: 19,
    tileSize: 256,

    renderSubLayers: props => {
      const {
        bbox: {west, south, east, north}
      } = props.tile;

      return new BitmapLayer(props, {
        data: null,
        image: props.data,
        bounds: [west, south, east, north]
      });
    }
  });

  return <DeckGL viewState={viewState} layers={[layer]} />;
}
```

```

## Indexing System

At each integer zoom level (`z`), the XY plane in the view space is divided into square tiles of the same size, each uniquely identified by their `x` and `y` index. When `z` increases by 1, the view space is scaled by 2, meaning that one tile at `z` covers the same area as four tiles at `z+1`.

When the `TileLayer` is used with a geospatial view such as the [MapView](/docs/api-reference/core/map-view.md), x, y, and z are determined from [the OSM tile index](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames).

When the `TileLayer` is used used with a non-geospatial view such as the [OrthographicView](/docs/api-reference/core/orthographic-view.md) or the [OrbitView](/docs/api-reference/core/orbit-view.md), `x` and `y` increment from the world origin, and each tile's width and height match that defined by the `tileSize` prop. For example, the tile `x: 0, y: 0` occupies the square between `[0, 0]` and `[tileSize, tileSize]`.

If you need to offset the `z` level at which the tiles are fetched in order to fetch tiles at a higher resolution in order to produce a "crisper" picture, there is a `zoomOffset` prop.


## Properties

Inherits all properties from [base `Layer`](/docs/api-reference/core/layer.md).

If using the default `renderSubLayers`, supports all [`GeoJSONLayer`](/docs/api-reference/layers/geojson-layer.md) properties to style features.

### Data Options

##### `data` (String|Array, optional)

- Default: `[]`

Either a URL template or an array of URL templates from which the tile data should be loaded.

If the value is a string: a URL template. Substrings `{x}` `{y}` and `{z}`, if present, will be replaced with a tile's actual index when it is requested.

If the value is an array: multiple URL templates. Each endpoint must return the same content for the same tile index. This can be used to work around [domain sharding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Domain_sharding), allowing browsers to download more resources simultaneously. Requests made are balanced among the endpoints, based on the tile index.


##### `getTileData` (Function, optional)

- Default: `tile => load(tile.url)`

If supplied, `getTileData` is called to retrieve the data of each tile. It receives one argument `tile` which contains the following fields:

- `x` (Number) - x index of the tile
- `y` (Number) - y index of the tile
- `z` (Number) - z index of the tile
- `url` (String) - resolved url of the tile if the `data` prop is provided, otherwise `null`
- `bbox` (Object) - bounding box of the tile. When used with a geospatial view, `bbox` is in the shape of `{west: <longitude>, north: <latitude>, east: <longitude>, south: <latitude>}`. When used with a non-geospatial view, `bbox` is in the shape of `{left, top, right, bottom}`.
- `signal` (Object) - an [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that may be signalled if there are too many queued requests. Note: only tiles that aren't visible will be aborted.

It should return either the tile data or a Promise that resolves to the tile data.

This prop is not required if `data` points to a supported format (JSON or image by default). Additional formats may be added by registering [loaders.gl](https://loaders.gl/modules/core/docs/api-reference/register-loaders) modules.

It is recommended to pass `signal` to any `fetch` calls and check its `aborted` property before doing any expensive computation. If `signal` is aborted, then throw or return falsy from `getTileData` so the data is not cached; do not return incomplete data. If `signal` is aborted, but `getTileData` still returns a truthy response, then its data will be cached.

```js
const {signal} = tile;
const data = fetch(url, {signal});

if (signal.aborted) {
   return null;
}
// Expensive computation on returned data
```


##### `tileSize` (Number, optional)

The pixel dimension of the tiles, usually a power of 2.

For geospatial viewports, tile size represents the target pixel width and height of each tile when rendered. Smaller tile sizes display the content at higher resolution, while the layer needs to load more tiles to fill the same viewport.

For non-geospatial viewports, the tile size should correspond to the true pixel size of the tiles.

- Default: `512`

##### `zoomOffset` (Number, optional)

This offset changes the zoom level at which the tiles are fetched.  Needs to be an integer.

- Default: `0`

##### `maxZoom` (Number|Null, optional)

The max zoom level of the layer's data. When overzoomed (i.e. `zoom > maxZoom`), tiles from this level will be displayed.

- Default: `null`

##### `minZoom` (Number, optional)

The min zoom level of the layer's data. When underzoomed (i.e. `zoom < minZoom`), the layer will not display any tiles unless `extent` is defined, to avoid issuing too many tile requests.

- Default: 0

##### `extent` (Array, optional)

The bounding box of the layer's data, in the form of `[minX, minY, maxX, maxY]`. If provided, the layer will only load and render the tiles that are needed to fill this box. 

- Default: `null`


##### `maxCacheSize` (Number, optional)

The maximum number of tiles that can be cached. The tile cache keeps loaded tiles in memory even if they are no longer visible. It reduces the need to re-download the same data over and over again when the user pan/zooms around the map, providing a smoother experience.

If not supplied, the `maxCacheSize` is calculated as `5` times the number of tiles in the current viewport.

- Default: `null`


##### `maxCacheByteSize` (Number, optional)

The maximum memory used for caching tiles. If this limit is supplied, `getTileData` must return an object that contains a `byteLength` field.

- Default: `null`


##### `refinementStrategy` (Enum, optional)

How the tile layer refines the visibility of tiles. One of the following:

* `'best-available'`: If a tile in the current viewport is waiting for its data to load, use cached content from the closest zoom level to fill the empty space. This approach minimizes the visual flashing due to missing content.
* `'no-overlap'`: Avoid showing overlapping tiles when backfilling with cached content. This is usually favorable when tiles do not have opaque backgrounds.
* `'never'`: Do not display any tile that is not selected.

- Default: `'best-available'`

##### `maxRequests` (Number, optional)

The maximum number of concurrent `getTileData` calls.

If `<= 0`, no throttling will occur, and `getTileData` may be called an unlimited number of times concurrently regardless of how long that tile is or was visible.

If `> 0`, a maximum of `maxRequests` instances of `getTileData` will be called concurrently. Requests may never be called if the tile wasn't visible long enough to be scheduled and started. Requests may also be aborted (through the `signal` passed to `getTileData`) if there are more than `maxRequests` ongoing requests and some of those are for tiles that are no longer visible.

If `getTileData` makes `fetch` requests against an HTTP 1 web server, then `maxRequests` should correlate to the browser's maximum number of concurrent `fetch` requests. For Chrome, the max is 6 per domain. If you use the `data` prop and specify multiple domains, you can increase this limit. For example, with Chrome and 3 domains specified, you can set `maxRequests=18`.

If the web server supports HTTP/2 (Open Chrome dev tools and look for "h2" in the Protocol column), then you can make an unlimited number of concurrent requests (and can set `maxRequests=-1`). Note that this will request data for every tile, no matter how long the tile was visible, and may increase server load.

- Default: `6`

### Render Options

##### `renderSubLayers` (Function, optional)

Renders one or an array of Layer instances with all the `TileLayer` props and the following props:

* `id`: An unique id for this sublayer
* `data`: Resolved from `getTileData`. As of deck.gl 8.2, this prop is always the data resolved from the Promise and is never a Promise itself.
* `tile`: An object containing tile index `x`, `y`, `z`, and `bbox` of the tile.

- Default: `props => new GeoJsonLayer(props)`

Note that the following sub layer props are overridden by `TileLayer` internally:

- `visible` (toggled based on tile visibility)
- `highlightedObjectIndex` (set based on the parent layer's highlight state)

##### `zRange` (Array, optional)

An array representing the range of minimum and maximum heights in the tile. This is designed to support extruded layers, such as the TerrainLayer, ensuring the right tiles are loaded and rendered. This prop currently only has effect when used with a geospatial view.

- Default: `null` (interpreted as `[0, 0]`)

##### `modelMatrix` (Matrix4, optional)

Affects both rendering and tile fetching to produce a transformed tile layer.  Note that this can result in tiles being fetched outside the `extent` prop, for example if the `modelMatrix` defines a rotation.

- Default: `null`

### Callbacks

##### `onViewportLoad` (Function, optional)

`onViewportLoad` is a function that is called when all tiles in the current viewport are loaded. An array of loaded [Tile](#tile) instances are passed as argument to this function


- Default: `data => null`


##### `onTileLoad` (Function, optional)

`onTileLoad` called when a tile successfully loads.

- Default: `() => {}`

Receives arguments:

- `tile` (Object) - the [tile](#tile) that has been loaded.

##### `onTileError` (Function, optional)

`onTileError` called when a tile failed to load.

- Default: `console.error`

Receives arguments:

- `error` (`Error`)

##### `onTileUnload` (Function, optional)

`onTileUnload` called when a tile is cleared from cache.

- Default: `() => {}`

Receives arguments:

- `tile` (Object) - the [tile](#tile) that has been cleared from cache.

## Tile

Class to hold the reading of a single tile

Properties:

- `x` (Number) - x index of the tile
- `y` (Number) - y index of the tile
- `z` (Number) - z index of the tile
- `bbox` (Object) - bounding box of the tile. When used with a geospatial view, `bbox` is in the shape of `{west: <longitude>, north: <latitude>, east: <longitude>, south: <latitude>}`. When used with a non-geospatial view, `bbox` is in the shape of `{left, top, right, bottom}`.
- `data` (Array) - tiles content as returned by `getTileData`.
