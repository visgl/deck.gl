# Widget Class

A widget is a UI component that can interact with deck.gl's cameras and layers. Some examples are:

- A tooltip that follows the pointer and provide information for the hovered object
- A marker pinned to a geo-location containing HTML content
- Buttons to manipulate the camera, such as +/- zoom buttons, a compass rose for the MapView, a gimble widget for the OrbitView, etc.
- A legend that offers visual comparison of sizes, colors etc. corresponding to the rendered layers and viewport. For example a distance ruler, a color scale for the HeatmapLayer, etc.

You may find many ready-to-use widgets in the `@deck.gl/widgets` module.

A widget is expected to implement the `Widget` interface. Here is a custom widget that shows a spinner while layers are loading:

```ts
import {Widget} from '@deck.gl/core';

class LoadingIndicator implements Widget {
  element?: HTMLDivElement;
  size: number;

  constructor(options: {
    size: number;
  }) {
    this.size = options.size;
  }

  onAdd() {
    const el = document.createElement('div');
    el.className = 'spinner';
    el.style.width = `${this.size}px`;
    // TODO - create animation for .spinner in the CSS stylesheet
    this.element = el;
    return el;
  }

  onRemove() {
    this.element = undefined;
  }

  onRedraw({layers}) {
    const isVisible = layers.some(layer => !layer.isLoaded);
    this.element.style.display = isVisible ? 'block' : 'none';
  }
}

deckgl.addWidget(new LoadingIndicator({size: 48}));
```

## Widget Interface

When a widget instance is added to Deck, the user can optionally specify a `viewId` that it is attached to (default `null`). If assigned, this widget will only respond to events occured inside the specific view that matches this id.

### Members

A `Widget` implements the following members.

##### `id`

Unique identifier of the widget.

##### `props` (Object)

Any options for the widget, as passed into the constructor and can be updated with `setProps`.

##### `viewId` (String | null)

* Default: `null`

The id of the view that the widget is attached to. If `null`, the widget receives events from all views. Otherwise, it only receives events from the view that matches this id.

##### `placement` (String, optional)

* Default: `'top-left'`

Widget positioning within the view. One of:

- `'top-left'`
- `'top-right'`
- `'bottom-left'`
- `'bottom-right'`
- `'fill'`
