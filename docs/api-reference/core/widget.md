# Widget

A widget is a UI component that can interact with deck.gl's layers and views.
You can write your own widgets, or use any of the many ready-to-use widgets in the [`@deck.gl/widgets`](../widgets/overview.md) module.

## Usage

The `Widget` class is a base class used to define new widgets and should not be instantiated directly by an application. See the [Widget Documentation](../widgets/overview.md) for information about how to write your own widgets.

## Types 

#### `WidgetProps` (object) {#props}

Options for the widget, as passed into the constructor and can be updated with `setProps`.

#### `id` {#id}

The `id` string must be unique among all your widgets at a given time. While a default `id` is provided, it is recommended to set `id` explicitly if you have multiple widgets of the same type.

#### `viewId` (string | null) {#viewid}

The `viewId` prop controls how a widget interacts with views. If `viewId` is defined, the widget is placed in that view and interacts exclusively with it; otherwise, it is placed in the root widget container and affects all views.

* Default: `null`

When a widget instance is added to Deck, the user can optionally specify a `viewId` that it is attached to (default `null`). If assigned, this widget will only respond to events occurred inside the specific view that matches this id.

The id of the view that the widget is attached to. If `null`, the widget receives events from all views. Otherwise, it only receives events from the view that matches this id.

#### `placement` (string, optional) {#placement}

Widget position within the view relative to the map container.

* Default: `'top-left'`

Widget positioning within the view. One of:

- `'top-left'`
- `'top-right'`
- `'bottom-left'`
- `'bottom-right'`
- `'fill'`

#### `style`

CSS inline style overrides.

```ts
  style?: Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration>;
```

#### `className`

Additional CSS classnames for interaction with custom stylesheets.
  
```ts
  className?: string;
```
