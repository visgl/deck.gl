This is a minimal standalone version of the ArcGIS Integration example
on [deck.gl](http://deck.gl) website.

Note that this example demonstrates using deck.gl as an ArcGIS addon. This approach subjects to API and behavior changes in the ArcGIS for JavaScript library. For other base map options, visit the project templates in [get-started](/examples/get-started).
