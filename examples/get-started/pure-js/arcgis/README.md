## Example: Use deck.gl with Esri ArcGIS API for JavaScript

This sample shows how to use the `@deck.gl/arcgis` module to add a deck.gl layer to an [ArcGIS JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) app.

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.

## Usage

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Commands:
* `npm start` is the development target, to serve the app and hot reload.
* `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle and write to disk.
