## Example: Use deck.gl with Apple Maps

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.

## Usage

To run this example, you need a [Apple Maps token](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs/creating_a_maps_token). 

You need to then set the `data-token` property in `index.html` to this token.

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Commands:
* `npm start` is the development target, to serve the app and hot reload.
* `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle and write to disk.
