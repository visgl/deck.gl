/**
 * The Aggregator interface describes a class that performs aggregation.
 *
 * _Aggregation_ is a 2-step process:
 * 1. Sort: Group a collection of _data points_ by some property into _bins_.
 * 2. Aggregate: for each _bin_, calculate a numeric output (_result_) from some metrics (_values_) from all its members.
 *    Multiple results can be obtained independently (_channels_).
 *
 * An implementation of the _Aggregator_ interface takes the following inputs:
 * - The number of data points
 * - The group that each data point belongs to, by mapping each data point to a _binId_ (integer or array of integers)
 * - The values to aggregate, by mapping each data point in each channel to one _value_ (number)
 * - The method (_aggregationOperation_) to reduce a list of values to one number, such as SUM
 *
 * And yields the following outputs:
 * - The aggregated values (_result_) as a list of numbers for each channel, comprised of one number per bin
 * - The [min, max] among all aggregated values (_domain_) for each channel
 *
