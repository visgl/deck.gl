Installing pydeck
=================

There are three steps before using pydeck:

        1. Install the library via pip or conda
        2. Enable pydeck for JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook
        3. Include an API key from Google Maps or Mapbox (Optional)

Via pip
^^^^^^^

Note: It is best practice to run this command in a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

        pip install pydeck

Via conda
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c conda-forge pydeck


Getting a Mapbox API key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, pydeck v0.6 onwards provides basemap tiles through Carto.

You can optionally use a Mapbox API key, by
registering for Mapbox via `this link <https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/>`_.
You should then create a `new public API token <https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/>`_.
You can learn more about Mapbox tokens via their `documentation <https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/#how-access-tokens-work>`_.

You can also use a Google Maps API key in a similar way. Currently Google Maps is not supported for 3D visualizations.

If you set a ``MAPBOX_API_KEY`` or ``GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`` environment variables, pydeck will detect them.

Enabling pydeck for Jupyter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Jupyter allows for more complex server/client interactions. You or your system administrator
must enable pydeck for use in Jupyter. Binary data transportation, data selection, and updating data over time
interactively only work if pydeck is enabled for use in a Jupyter environments.

To enable pydeck for Jupyter Notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

        jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py pydeck
        jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py pydeck

To enable pydeck for JupyterLab (on Mac/Unix-like systems):

.. code-block:: bash

        jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        DECKGL_SEMVER=`python -c "import pydeck; print(pydeck.frontend_semver.DECKGL_SEMVER)"`
        jupyter labextension install @deck.gl/jupyter-widget@$DECKGL_SEMVER


pydeck also works in Google Colab. While you can install pydeck in Google Colab via pip, it is not yet enabled for server use.

Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to install the library from its source:

.. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl
        cd deck.gl/bindings/pydeck
        yarn bootstrap
        pip install .

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to install pydeck for development, you may want to use the ``make`` commands:

.. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl
        cd deck.gl/bindings/pydeck
        make setup-env
        . env/bin/activate
        make init
        make prepare-jupyter

You can run the local tests to verify that the installation worked via ``make test``.

Note on pre-releases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are installing a pydeck prerelease and using JupyterLab, you must install an exact version
of ``@deck.gl/jupyter-widget``. You can read this version from pydeck itself:

.. code-block:: bash

        DECKGL_SEMVER=`python -c "import pydeck; print(pydeck.frontend_semver.DECKGL_SEMVER)"`
        jupyter labextension install @deck.gl/jupyter-widget@$DECKGL_SEMVER
