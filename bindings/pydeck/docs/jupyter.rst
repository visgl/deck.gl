Jupyter-specific features
=========================

.. WARNING::
   Jupyter-specific features are not currently supported in pydeck v0.9+.

Jupyter environments offer unique opportunities for two-way data interaction,
sharing data between the Python backend and visualization in deck.gl.

To use a visualization with these features, call :meth:`pydeck.bindings.deck.Deck.show` on the :class:`pydeck.bindings.deck.Deck` object
rather than :meth:`pydeck.bindings.deck.Deck.to_html`.

- *Data updates.* By calling :meth:`pydeck.bindings.deck.Deck.update` on a :class:`pydeck.bindings.deck.Deck` object with a new visualization configuration, you can seamless push new data into a pre-existing visualization.

- *Binary data transfer.* For certain data sets pydeck can support many millions of points by using Jupyter's socket-level communication. Further documentation is `here <binary_transfer.html>`__.

- *Data selection.* Data can be selected within a pydeck visualization and pushed back to the client. Holding Command while clicking allows the user to select multiple points.
