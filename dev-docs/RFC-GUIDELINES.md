# RFC Guidelines

Implementation of non-trivial new features should typically be started off with the creation of an RFC (Request for Comments) to make sure we have a complete story. It also allow the bigger team (as well as the community) to comment and contribute insights.


## Status


| RFC Status       | Description |
| ---              | --- |
| **Proposed**     | Call for an RFC to be written |
| **Draft**        | Work-in-progress, not ready for formal review |
| **Pre-Approved** | No major initial objections, draft pre-approved for prototyping |
| **Review**       | Ready for formal review |
| **Approved**     | Approved, ready for implementation |
| **Experimental** | Approved and implemented as experimental API |
| **Implemented**  | Approved and implemented (as officially supported API) |
| **Deferred**     | Review uncovered reasons not to proceed at this time |
| **Rejected**     | Review uncovered reasons not to proceed |


## Reviews

The core developers will review RFCs (and of course, comments from the community are always welcome). Recommended review criteria are:

* Use cases - is the proposal generic enough

* Backwards compatibility

* Complexity - does it add much complexity?

* Does it consider all angles (rendering/picking/event handling/...).
